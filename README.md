# NFL 2023 Player Insights - Power BI

## Introduction
This project allowed me to exercise Power BI skills in a way that I found to be useful. The data was obtained using this [tool I created](https://github.com/landenng/nfl-scraper) and simply put into a dashboard for personal study and as a data exploration project. The goal was to create a dashboard that would be useful for me to help quickly view desirable stats during fantasy football season. If you have any suggestions to add, please contact me and I will look into adding the desired features.

In this dashboard, I created five separate pages where the user can analyze what I consider to be the most important stats when doing player analysis for fantasy football. On each page, I also included the original table from the website where the data was obtained for a quick tabular view of all stats for each player.

### Page 1: Quarterback Analysis
On the left, I created a bar chart showing the completions compared to attempts that quarterbacks made during the 2023 season as these stats are essential when picking a QB during fantasy season. I also added three slicers at the top to allow the user to filter through attempts, completion percentage, and the amount of games played. The scatterplot I created shows the amount of interceptions thrown. This was important to me since I wanted to quickly be able to see how much the opposing team was intercepting from any QB I would be interested in picking up for my team.

### Page 2: Receiving Analysis
The bar chart on the left on this page shows the number of receptions compared to targets for a quick view of the comparisons between receivers. The slicers in this page allow the user to filter by number of receptions, completion percentage, and the amount of games played as these are incredibly important stats for receivers and fantasy players may want to quickly be able to sort some players out based on preferences. Instead of the scatter plot, I created a bar chart of the total yards gained by each receiver after a reception sorted by the amount of yards since I wanted to be able to visualize this stat in particular due to how important it is when choosing receivers for a fantasy football team.

### Page 3: Rushing Analysis
The bar chart displays total yards scored through rushing by each player as this is most important to me when picking players that rush. The four slicer allow the user to filter by rush attempts, total rushing yards, average yards gained per play, and the number of games played. The bar chart on the right now allows a quick visual to the user of the average yards per play. In addition, the bars turn red when the average yards per play turn negative as seen in the second image below.

### Page 4: Defense Analysis
The left bar chart now displays solo tackles, assist tackles, and total tackles since these stats are essential when picking your defender as interceptions rarely happen. If the user is interested in defenders that intercept often, they can quickly view this through the table. The slicers now allow the user to sort between defenders total tackles, solo tackles, assist tackles, sacks, and number of games played. The right bar chart displays sack yards.

### Page 5: Kicking Analysis
On the left we now have two bar charts that shows field goal attemps compared to field goals made and extra point attempts compared to extra points made. The slicers allows the user to filter through certain field goal percentages, extra point percentages, longest field goals, and the number of games played.

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard allows users to interactively analyze 2023 player statistics quickly and visually. Uses for this dashboard would be during fantasy football season. As stated in the Introduction, if you have any additional features to request, I am always welcome to learning more about Power BI and up for the task of adding your desired feature.
